  <h1>Colosseum</h1>

  <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
     Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built,
      and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction 
      began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under
       his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of 
       Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian 
       dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian
       : Anfiteatro Flavio
    by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
    The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. 
    It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average 
    audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal 
    hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly 
    mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was 
    later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, 
    quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
