  <p>The Colosseum , originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater or 
    simply Amphitheatrum (in Italian : Anfiteatro ) [1] , located in the center of the city of Rome , 
    is the largest Roman amphitheater in the world (capable of containing a number of spectators estimated 
    between 50,000 and 87,000). It is the most important Roman amphitheater, as well as the most 
    imposing monument of ancient Rome that has come down to us.</p>
