<h1>Vatican Museums</h1>


<p>The Vatican Museums (in Italian Musei Vaticani ) are the galleries and the set of rooms of artistic value owned by the Church and accessible to the public in Vatican City .

    They show works from an extensive collection of the Catholic Church . 
    Its founding basis was the private collection of Julius II , who was elected pope in 1503; 
    later other popes have been increasing the extensive collections that these museums consist of. 
    This museum complex is made up of different thematic museum buildings, pontifical buildings, galleries,
     monuments and gardens. 
    The Vatican Library , one of the best in the world, also belongs to this set of buildings .
